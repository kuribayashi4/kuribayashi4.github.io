        <h1>For Prospective Students</h1>
        My research areas are at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and computational cognitive modeling, typically focusing on incremental language processing of language models (LMs) and humans, or interpretability topics (see my recent publications).
        I'm originally from NLP background and explore how the NLP techniques can be exported to relevant fields of language science.
        With such a background, and given that my team is in the NLP (not linguistics) department of MBZUAI, if your main research area is NLP and have an interest in its somewhat more language-focused side, I will be a good fit.
        Alternatively, if you already have a strong background in linguistics/cogsci and want to integrate modern NLP techniques for your specific interest, I would also be a good fit.
        Otherwise, if you want to systematically and comprehensively learn linguistics/cogsci fields from scratch, I (MBZUAI group) will not be the good fit. 
    
        <h2>PhD/MSc Opportunities</h2>
        <p>Please directly apply via <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/graduate-admission-process/">MBZUAI admission page</a>, and specify Tatsuki as a preferred supervisor (in, e.g., Research Statement). 
            The official supervisor assignment will be made after admission, and you will also be able to (but subject to change) specify additional faculty in the university as a co-supervisor.</p>

        <h2>Postdoctoral Researcher Opportunities</h2>
        <p>With somewhat restricted budget, I may not be currently able to support multiple postdoctoral researchers at the same time. However, if you have a strong track record and a well-defined research proposal that aligns with my interests, I encourage you to reach out to discuss potential opportunities.</p>

        <h2>Internship Opportunities</h2>
        <p>I don't currently accept internship applications.</p>

        <h2>Short-visit Opportunities</h2>
        <p>I occasionally host short-term visitors (e.g., for a few weeks, or one month) who are interested in collaborating on research projects. If you are interested in such an opportunity, please reach out with your CV and a brief description of your research interests.
            If you already have budget/scholarship and a good research plan, I'm happy to discuss visiting opportunities.</p>
